Here's a few game that I want run together with a pitch and some links for further reading.


## [Call Of Cthulhu - Gaslight](https://www.chaosium.com/cthulhu-by-gaslight-investigators-guide-hardcover/) {#call-of-cthulhu-gaslight}

**[Crunch:Low/Medium]**
Victorian era London. Class divides are strong and discrimination is everywhere. Chuck in the horrors of Cthulhu to break down the hierarchy and everyones sanity.

Very simple to play but with lots of depth to dive into as well. You aren't meant to defeat everything you see because sometimes it's a god of unknownable horrors.

## [Delta Green](https://shop.arcdream.com/products/delta-green-the-role-playing-game-hardback-slipcase-set?ref=delta-green.com) {#delta-green}

**[Crunch:Low/Medium]**

The world is ending and right before calamity the good guys sweep in and save the day. You are those good guys but what does it cost your sanity to see the things you have seen.

Based on Call Of Cthulhu but modern era. Easy to play and lots of cool character building systems. You should hopefully save the world but maybe not make it out alive.

## [Mothership](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/pages/mothership-rpg) {#mothership}

**[Crunch: Low]**
A crew tries (and often fails) to survive the vast expansive of space and all of the human and inhuman horrors it contains.

Simple system with very little to learn to pickup and play. But your character is very unlikely to change much and will almost certainly be dead.

## [Worlds Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition) {#worlds-without-number}

![](/images/worlds_without_number.png)
**[Crunch: High]**
Old school fantasy swords and sorcery. Delve into dungeons, stab things and collect loot.
