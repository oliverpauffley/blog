Victorian era London. Class divides are strong and discrimination is everywhere. Chuck in the horrors of Cthulhu to break down the hierarchy and everyones sanity.

Very simple to play but with lots of depth to dive into as well. You aren't meant to defeat everything you see because sometimes it's a god of unknownable horrors.

The world is ending and right before calamity the good guys sweep in and save the day. You are those good guys but what does it cost your sanity to see the things you have seen.

Based on Call Of Cthulhu but modern era. Easy to play and lots of cool character building systems. You should hopefully save the world but maybe not make it out alive.

*[Crunch: Low]*
A crew tries (and often fails) to survive the vast expansive of space and all of the human and inhuman horrors it contains.

Simple system with very little to learn to pickup and play. But your character is very unlikely to change much and will almost certainly be dead.

*[Crunch: High]*
Old school fantasy swords and sorcery. Delve into dungeons, stab things and collect loot.

Sometimes called Old School Renaissance (OSR), it's tactical and often brutal so you have to think before you do things! Often battles can be over quickly with a decisive plan.
